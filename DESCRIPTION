Description: seasonal is an easy-to-use R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS, a
    seasonal adjustment software produced, distributed, and maintained by the
    United States Census Bureau. X-13ARIMA-SEATS combines and extends the

    the TRAMO-SEATS (developed by the Bank of Spain) software packages. The
    best way to start is to have a look at the vignette.
